        <h2>Courses in first semester - Networks and Fundamentals, Problem Solving and Programming, Information Technology and Design Thinking Studio</h2>

        <h3>Networks and Fundamentals:</h3>
        <p>The Networks and Fundamentals course is one of the courses I found very interesting as it introduced us to the basics of networking, the different network models and protocols. The most fun part of it all is device configuration using the packet tracer application.</p>

        <h4>Problem Solving and Programming</h4>
        <p>Problem Solving and Programming is a another one of my courses that I am undertaking during the first semester, this course started of with the bsaics of coding and Python is the language that we're currently working with. Over the period of the course I have gained knowledge on If statements, while loops, strings, lists and for loops and lastly functions and debugging.</p>

        <h5>Information Technology Fundamentals</h5>
        <p>Information Technology Fundamentals is one very important subject that taught me about the theoretical side of IT while also teaching us many practical skills such as working with excel, html, css and javascript. </p>
    
        <h6>Design Thinking Studio</h6>
        <p>Design Thinking Studio was one significant course that all students must study as it was a course that allowed students to work in big teams, and give us the opprotunity to communicate our ideas and show our leadership and teamwork skills and ultimately to see how numerous students implemented design thinking in their project. </p>
