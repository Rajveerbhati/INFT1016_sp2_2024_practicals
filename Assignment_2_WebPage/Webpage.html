        <p style="text-align: center;"> My first year university has been a very weird experience as the transition from highschool to university was very significant and a vast one. </p>

        <h3 style="text-align: center;">My experience so far</h3>

        <p class="border"> Learning how to program has been one very challanging task for me as I am someone who has had no prior experience with any sort of languages or even IT in general. I was among the many that were unsure about what degree to choose but the bachelor of IT was something that stood out to me the most during the end of high school so I decided I will look further into this degree instead.</p>

        <h3 style="text-align: center;">First day at university</h3>

        <p class="border1">If there's something that I remember so vividly, it has to be my first day at uni it felt like that you've just moved to different schools or it's your first day of high-school and you're all alone once again hoping to find people that share the same interests as you. Apart from not being very clueless I was also very scared about not knowing a single thing about the course. I remember coming to my Networking Fundamentals class and was absouletly terrified with Packet Tracer as I had zero clue on what it was and what its purpose was, this single though haunted me for whole of first week leading me to question myself and my choice of degree. But ofcourse as time went on I gradually started gaining interest and put things together and figure it all out once and for all.</p>
